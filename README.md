## Study Summary
This summary provides an overview of the study conducted on web development. It covers the main concepts and features learned during the study.
#### Express.js
Is a web framework for Node.js that provides a flexible set of features for building web applications, including handling HTTP requests, managing middleware and rendering templates.
#### Middleware
Is a component that runs between a request and a response, allowing for additional tasks such as authentication, validation, data manipulation, and others to be performed. They keep the code more organized and scalable.
#### Handlebars
Handlebars is a template engine that allows you to create dynamic HTML. It is interesting to use on the server-side because it offers a simple and easy-to-use data visualization modeling solution.
#### Next.js
Is a framework that simplifies building web applications with React, with server-side rendering (SSR) and statically generated. This means that pages are pre-rendered on the server and stored as static files, delivered quickly to the user without the need for additional rendering. This improves speed and the user experience.
#### RESTful APIs
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a software programming interface that allows developers to access resources or data from other applications or services. A RESTful API is a specific implementation of an API that follows REST (Representational State transfer) design conventions. It uses the HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) standard to perform operations with the resources in the API and returns the responses in the JSON format, which is a lightweight data format that is easy for machines to read. The URL is used to identify and locate the resources in the API, which can be information, actions, or any other data that the API offers.

#### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
The MVC is a software architecture pattern that separates the application into three components: Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data logic of the application, the View presents the information to the user, and the Controller is responsible for communication between these two. It processes information received from the View, calls necessary operations in the Model (updating if necessary), and sends the results back to the View to be displayed to the user. Usually, the server side deals more with the Controller and Model. The View is very basic and passed in a way that the frontend will understand and render in a more attractive way.
